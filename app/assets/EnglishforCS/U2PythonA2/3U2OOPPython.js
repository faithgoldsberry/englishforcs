      <h1>Creating Objects in Python</h1>
      <p>
        Maybe now you ask yourselfâ€”how can I use Python to create objects?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an excellent question. Python is very easy to use to create objects because it's similar to creating variables. There are a few{" "}

          keywords
        </span>{" "}
        you need to know first.

        An{" "}

        </span>{" "}
        in Python is an object created from a class. Remember that a{" "}

          title="A blueprint or template for creating objects."
        >
          class
        </span>{" "}
        is a template for an object. To create a class in Python, you need to use the keyword <code>class</code>. After that, you name the class and add a colon.{" "}

          Spacing
        </span>{" "}
        is very important in Python. After you put the colon, press Enter and make sure you use a tab to add its methods and attributes.

          functions
        </span>{" "}
        or methods in Python is easy too. You use the keyword <code>def</code> (like definition) and name the method. Your function or method needs parentheses immediately after, and inside, you pass it{" "}

          className="hover-term"
          title="Values that are provided to a function to customize its behavior."
        >
          arguments
        </span>. Arguments can be used in your function. After that, you write the colon and follow the same spacing to define your function.

      <p>
        Attributes would just be variables you associate with your class.
